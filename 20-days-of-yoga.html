			<h1 class="title">20 Days of Yoga</h1>
				<p class="description"><i>Yoga is one of the most effective, healthy ways to exercise your mind and body from the inside out. The purpose of this exercise is to remind yogis that yoga is not a pose but a practice! This does not mean you have to take a full sweaty 90-minute class every day (feel free if you like!), but that you can incorporate yoga into your life somehow. For 20 consecutive days, hold one pose each day for at least five minutes.</i><p>
